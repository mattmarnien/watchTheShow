# watchTheShow

Watch the show is a simple app to track the shows you want to watch, track what youve seen, and remind yourself to watch some again. The application is fully responsive across mobile device sizes/

# Technologies:

Watch the show was made using html, css, bootstrap, javascript, jquery, mysql, node.js, express, handlebars, and a home-made ORM. It makes use of the MVC model and is easily scalable to add new fuinctionality.

# Future Plans:

I plan to add individual user accounts to track by user as well as add information about each show added and options for streaming the show.
